# 4th-Year-FYP
# Virtual Conversational Agent (VCA)

My BAI final year project of creating an emotionally expressive virtual human capable of natural conversation and real-time facial animation. Developed in **Unreal Engine 5.4.3** using a **Metahuman avatar**, the VCA combines services including **Dialogflow CX**, **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, and **NVIDIA Audio2Face** to create an agent that can deliver intelligent, lifelike interactions.

This project is developed for educational and research purposes and may be adapted under the relevant licenses of the integrated tools (Google Cloud, Unreal Engine, NVIDIA).
